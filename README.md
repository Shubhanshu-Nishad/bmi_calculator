<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## **About The Project**

## What is BMI ?
Body mass index, or BMI, is a measure of body size. It combines a personâ€™s weight with their height. The results of a BMI measurement can give an idea about whether a person has the correct weight for their height.

## How to Calculate BMI ?
BMI calculation is based on simple formula using person's weight and height.
The formula for BMI = kg/m2 where kg is person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in meters squared. In simplified format it would be

BMI = (Weight in Kilograms)/(Height in meters * Height in meters)

For USC Units: The formula for BMI = 703*lbs/in2 where lbs is person's weight in Pounds and in2 is their height in inches squared. In simplified format it would be

BMI = 703*(Weight in Pounds)/(Height in inches * Height in inches)

For example if person's weight is 55kg and height is 160cm then
BMI = 55/(1.60 * 1.60) = 21.48

BMI calculator indicate whether person falls under healthy weight, underweight or overweight. If person's BMI is out of healthy range, their health
risk may significantly increases.
